## Introduction 
A 4 - 5 sentence "mini-introduction" to what this study is exploring, including basic background information about the subject, site and study (with citations as needed), and a brief overview of what is included in the exploratory report. You should probably do this last.


```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(effsize)
library(broom)
```


#### Read in data 
- Use clean_names() function to "tidy" data. This will change titles to lowercase for easier data wrangling. 
```{r}
bonanza_hares <- read.csv(here("data", "bonanza_hares.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```
